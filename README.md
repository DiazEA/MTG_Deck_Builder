# MTG_Deck_Builder 
Hello and thanks for checking out my MTG Deck Builder project. I have been playing Magic: The Gathering for about 15 years and thought this would be a great way to grow my programming and data manipulation skills. This is a very early build that runs in the terminal but I will continue to add to this project and build up its functionality.

# Description
Currently this program is designed to help make a commander deck with more deck formats to follow in further updates. The program reads a csv file that contains the MTG cards and allows the user to make a deck by inputing card names to the terminal. Once the deck is complete, the program outputs an excel file with the deck along with mana intensity and mana production data that the user can then use to understand their deck better. The functionality to load an excel file is included with follow up functionality such as deck editing coming soon.

# How To Use
This project currently runs in the terminal. To use, run the code and respond to the prompts that are shown in the terminal. 
When entering the name of magic cards type the name without capitalization or commas. Other forms of punctuation such as "'" and "-" are still necessary.
When entering a double sided card, enter the name of the front of the card followed by a space, "//" , space, and last the name on the back of the card. For example: "urabrask // the great work"
The cards are currently updated up to the recent LOTR MTG set realese.

# Future of the Project
There are some known bugs that I will be working on soon. I will also be updating the cards soon after a set realeses. The end goal for this project will be a user friendly app that would give users details about the deck.
